# Financial Literacy — First Principles

Financial literacy is not about wealth.
It is about **control**.

Before investing, optimizing, or planning, you must understand what money actually does in your life.

## The Only Three Questions That Matter
1. How much comes in?
2. How much goes out?
3. How long can this continue?

Everything else is secondary.

## What This Phase Is For
This phase exists to:
- Stabilize
- Reduce anxiety
- Create predictability

You are not here to grow money.
You are here to **stop losing clarity**.

## Common Traps to Ignore
- Passive income fantasies
- Complex tracking systems
- Over-optimization
- Comparing yourself to others

## The Rule
If you cannot explain your finances in one minute, they are not under control.

## Completion Rule
You do not need to take action yet.
Understanding comes before behavior.

This lesson is complete once read.
