# Introduction to Git

## Introduction

Git is like a really **epic save button** for your files and directories. Officially, Git is a **version control system**.

A *save* in a text editor records all of the words in a document as a single file. You are only ever given one record of the file, such as `essay.doc`, unless you make duplicate copies (which is difficult to remember to do and keep track of): `essay-draft1.doc`, `essay-draft2.doc`, `essay-final.doc`.

However, a *save* in Git records differences in the files and folders AND keeps a **historical record of each save**. This feature is a game changer. As an individual developer, Git enables you to review how your project grows and to easily look at or restore file states from the past. Once connected to a network, Git allows you to push your project to GitHub or other alternatives for sharing and collaborating with other developers.

While Git works on your *local* machine, **GitHub** is a *remote* storage facility on the web for your coding projects. This means that by learning Git, you can showcase your portfolio on GitHub. This is important because almost all software development companies consider using Git to be an **essential skill** for modern web developers. Having a GitHub portfolio provides proof to future potential employers of what you are capable of.

In this lesson, we briefly explore what Git is and what it's useful for. In the next lesson, we go over the basic workflow for using Git.

## Lesson overview

- Explain what Git and GitHub are and the differences between the two.
- Describe the differences between Git and a text editor in terms of what they save and their record keeping.
- Describe why Git is useful for an individual developer and a team of developers.

## Git vs text editor

A text editor saves a single snapshot of a file. Git saves a **history** of changes. Each "save" in Git (called a **commit**) records what changed since the last commit. You can go back to any previous commit, compare versions, and work on different lines of development (branches) at once. So Git is not just "save"; it is version control.

## Git is local, GitHub is remote

**Git** runs on your computer. It tracks changes in your project folder and keeps the history on your machine. You can use Git without ever going online.

**GitHub** is a website that hosts Git repositories in the cloud. You push your local Git history to GitHub to back it up, share it, and collaborate. Other services (Bitbucket, GitLab, etc.) do similar things; the curriculum focuses on GitHub.

## Why Git is useful

**For an individual developer:** You can experiment freely knowing you can revert to any previous state. You can see exactly what changed and when. You can maintain a clean history of your project as it grows.

**For a team:** Multiple people can work on the same project. Everyone has a full copy of the history. Changes can be merged in a controlled way. Git records who changed what and when, which is essential for collaboration and code review.

Getting comfortable with Git and maintaining a GitHub profile will serve you throughout your career.
