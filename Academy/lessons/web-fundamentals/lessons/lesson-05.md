# Join the Community

## Introduction

Working and collaborating with other people is an important part of working as a web developer. Therefore, we encourage you to participate in an online chat community. By joining the community, you can grow alongside other learners and help each other learn web development.

## Lesson overview

- Learn about the community and how to join it.
- Explain how to ask good and detailed questions.
- Explain good practices for helping others with their questions.

## Why a community is awesome for you

Learning web development will be a long and arduous journey, but you can make the marathon a lot more fun by getting involved in a community. No matter what pace you are doing the curriculum, there will always be people a few steps ahead of you that are willing to help. Furthermore, helping others that are a few steps behind you is a great way to deepen your own understanding and make your learning stick.

When you're slogging through the desert of despair, where your code doesn't work or even make sense to you anymore, you can find an oasis of knowledge and encouragement in the community. Veterans love to help fill in knowledge gaps and provide new insights and perspectives on how to improve your code. We've all been there before!

Remember that project you struggled so hard to figure out and that you're so proud of finishing? Through the community, you will get to share your work and progress with those who fully appreciate how much hard work went into it.

## Before asking for help

As most of the projects are designed to push you to your limit, please remember that there is always a community to turn to! You don't need to know how to solve every problem straight away, BUT you do need to have a general idea of where you are going. This becomes really important when asking your questions because sometimes the problem is your **approach** and not your code.

If you're feeling stuck, it's a good time to pause and take a breather. Break the problem down into little pieces and then decide what is really holding you back. We call this technique rubber duck debugging.

You should also use search engines to find relevant information for your problem. You can also look back at previous lessons for tools that you can apply to the current task.

If these methods don't yield a solution for you, then it's time to reach out to the community and ask for help.

## Asking for help

So you've spent some time struggling to solve the problem on your own, and now it's time to ask for help. The first thing to keep in mind is: don't ask to ask. Just ask your question. While this is a simple idea, it can help you get answers to your questions much faster and will make it easier for others to feel comfortable offering you help.

When asking your question, you should help the community help you by putting together a great question.

When asking your question, please remember to include the context:

- What do you think the problem is?
- What exactly do you want to happen?
- What is actually happening?
- How did you get there?
- What have you tried so far?

If you can't pinpoint the problem, you can share a **screenshot**. This is especially useful for showing the output of commands in the command line. However, you should always include the corresponding files containing the error. Even if it is a short amount of code, providing it in the proper format along with a screenshot of the output is helpful to those debugging it.

Sometimes there might be no one around to help you with your issue. That is the ideal time to get familiar with search. Search for specific keywords or error messages to see if anyone else had a similar issue before and how they solved it!

## Formatting your questions

Asking your questions in a readable format helps everyone debug them better.

If you're having trouble on the command line, make sure to include both your input and the error message you're getting.

In chat rooms, code can be displayed differently from normal sentences by using **backticks**.

**For a single line of code:** use one backtick before and after your code.

**For multiple lines of code:** use three backticks on a separate line above and below your code. You can also use code highlighting to add color to your multi-line code by specifying the language (e.g. JavaScript).

## How to help others solve coding problems

Not only is it important to know how to ask an effective question, but it is also important to know how to help others effectively.

1. **Instead of answering the question, guide them to the answer.** Unless the problem is a simple typo or syntax error, it is more beneficial to guide them to find their own answer. Start by asking probing questions.

2. **Help only when you are certain of the answer.** If you are not 100% certain of the answer, you may end up doing more harm than good.

3. **Help only when no one else is currently helping.** If somebody is already getting help, do not jump in the middle of the conversation.

4. **Help only when you have plenty of time.** If you do not have much time to help, please let someone else answer the question.

5. **Adjust your expectations to their level.** If the question does not reveal where they are in the curriculum, ask them so that you can adjust your expectations to their knowledge level.

6. **Ask for clarifications.** If the question seems confusing or ambiguous, ask for more clarity.

7. **Ask for live code.** If the question needs to have live code to fully understand or debug, ask them to use an appropriate online REPL to provide it.

8. **Do not answer Googleable questions.** Learning how to research these questions is a very important skill for developers. When we answer these questions, it hinders their personal growth.

9. **Do not answer questions covered in the curriculum.** If the answer is provided in the curriculum, direct them to review that lesson.

10. **Answer the question before pointing out other problems.** When helping someone it can be easy to spot other problems in their code. Resolve the original question first.

11. **Encourage students to use a debugger.** It is common for students to not understand the importance of using a debugger to look at the values of their variables.

12. **Watch for students that need to take a step back.** It is common for students to focus too hard on a problem. Politely encourage them to step back and take a break.

13. **Watch for students that are in over their head.** It is common for students to skip a lesson or project. Politely encourage them to go back and reread the curriculum.

14. **Admit when the problem goes beyond your current knowledge.** If it goes beyond your current knowledge, admit that you are unsure and let someone else help.

15. **Be patient.** Helping others solve a problem is not always easy.

16. **Duck out of the conversation if you get frustrated.** You are a volunteer and are not obligated to help when things get out of hand. Politely duck out and let someone else step up.
