# Computer Basics

## Introduction

While learning to code, you'll be spending most of your time on a computer. Hence, understanding how to work with your computer is crucial. In this lesson, we introduce concepts that will quickly get you up to speed with some computer basics.

## Lesson overview

This section contains a general overview of topics that you will learn in this lesson.

- Computer software and hardware.
- How to take screenshots.
- The importance of strong passwords.

## What is a computer?

A computer is an electronic device that can store, process, and retrieve data. It runs an **operating system** (such as Windows, macOS, or Linux), which manages hardware and software and provides a way for you to interact with the machine.

## Software: open source vs closed source

**Closed source** software is proprietary; you cannot see or modify its source code. **Open source** software makes its source code available, so others can view, use, and contribute to it. Many development tools (including the ones you will use in this curriculum) are open source.

## Taking screenshots

Knowing how to take a screenshot is essential. You will use screenshots to share error messages, show your work, or ask for help. On most systems you can use a keyboard shortcut (e.g. Print Screen or a combination like Win+Shift+S on Windows, Cmd+Shift+3 on Mac). On Linux, check your system settings for screenshot shortcuts.

## Strong passwords

Use strong, unique passwords for your accounts—especially for your computer, email, and services like GitHub. A strong password is long, mixes letters (upper and lower case), numbers, and symbols, and is not based on obvious personal information. Avoid reusing the same password across sites.

## Summary

Getting comfortable with your computer—its operating system, how to capture what’s on screen, and how to keep your accounts secure—will make everything that follows in the curriculum easier.
