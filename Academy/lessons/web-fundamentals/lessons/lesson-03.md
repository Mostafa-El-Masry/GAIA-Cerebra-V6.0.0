# Motivation and Mindset

## Introduction

Learning to code is incredibly rewarding but can also be difficult and frustrating. Like any skill worth knowing, it takes time to acquire, and it can't be learned in a weekend or even a month. With that said, we believe anyone can learn how to program as long as they are willing to put in the time and effort.

So before we get into the meat of the curriculum, we'll cover the following aspects to help you get the most out of your learning: factors that will help you succeed in learning to code and the pitfalls that you should try to avoid.

## Lesson overview

- Recognize sensible mindsets that promote healthy learning.
- Understand helpful ways to approach learning and struggling.
- Things to avoid along your learning journey.

## Motivation

Take a moment to think about why you have decided to learn programming.

- Do you want to have a fulfilling career that pays well?
- Are you excited by the creative outlet programming provides?
- Are you determined to develop the skills and abilities to build any app you can think of?
- Do you want to start your own company by turning an app idea into reality?

Your motivation could be a combination of these reasons or something else entirely. Whatever it is, hold on tightly to your motivation — this will be what pulls you through to the end of this journey, giving you a definitive goal to aim towards.

## Growth mindset

Your mindset is very important when teaching yourself any new skills, not just programming. Your mindset will have more of an impact on your chances of success than just about anything else.

Someone with the **fixed mindset** believes if they don't get something on their first attempt, they never will. They believe that they aren't smart enough to be able to do or understand some things.

However, there is a wide body of research showing that intelligence is not fixed but can instead be developed. Someone with the **growth mindset** believes they can get better at anything with effort and persistence.

What does this mean for you? It means you can learn new skills and develop new talents with **persistence and grit**.

There will be many times throughout your learning that you will get stuck on a concept or a programming problem and may find yourself questioning your ability to learn programming. When you find yourself in this position, remind yourself that you may not get it *yet* but that with persistence and grit you will. Struggling with something is growth. It doesn't matter how long you struggle with a concept or project; all that matters is that you have the grit and tenacity to see it through. That's how real learning happens.

While you're working through the curriculum, embrace the struggles you encounter with difficult concepts and complex projects. Be sure to celebrate your persistence in overcoming those struggles!

When you find yourself questioning your abilities, reflect on the successes you have already achieved while learning to program: the projects you have completed and the concepts you once didn't understand but now do. This is all the proof you need that you can do it.

## The learning process

Learning concepts and then practicing them will help you to more fully understand how things work and fit together. Projects are the ultimate method for ensuring that your theoretical understanding aligns with how the programming concepts and techniques actually operate.

When learning, your mind will consistently switch between focus mode and diffuse mode. **Focus mode** occurs when you are consciously focusing on learning, reading, watching videos, or working on a project. **Diffuse mode** occurs subconsciously, at times when you are not actively learning, such as when you're doing the dishes, exercising, or sleeping. In this state, your mind goes about the business of connecting what you have been learning to the other things you know. This is where breakthroughs happen.

It's important to know that your mind goes through these two states when learning because you can utilize this to make your learning more efficient. When stuck on a concept or project, taking a break to refresh and let your subconscious work on making connections more often than not yields a solution to your problem. The trick is to put effort into solving the problem first and then take a break.

In short, understand it, practice it, and finally teach it.

Teaching what you know to others is a great way to solidify what you have learned and can often reveal holes in your knowledge that you wouldn't have identified otherwise.

## What to do when you're stuck

You will inevitably get stuck at some point in the curriculum. Whatever it is, use the following tools to get unstuck:

- **Search it:** You can be certain someone else out there has encountered the same problem as you at some point. A quick search can often lead to a solution.
- **Take a break:** Allow your diffuse learning state to work on the problem.
- **Ask for help:** Come prepared with your research. People will be more willing to help you when they can see you have already put effort into trying to figure out the solution on your own.

## A note on AI code generation

As technology advances, we have seen some incredible tools emerge that can help accelerate coding capacity. One particular area that has exploded in popularity lately is the usage of Large Language Models (LLMs) and generative AIs for code completion and code generation.

While these tools are amazing, learners should be aware of the impacts that using such tools can have on core competency. For learners who are new to programming, tools like ChatGPT or GitHub Copilot can result in blindspots and gaps in your knowledge.

1. By using a generative AI, learners may miss the opportunity to discover how something works and why things are done that way.
2. Asking good questions is an important skill, and relying on generative AI instead of asking people can delay the development of this skill.
3. Learning to talk about the code that one writes is another important skill. In a professional environment, you will likely be doing code reviews where you have to explain the how and why behind what you are presenting.
4. The output of generative AI must be closely scrutinized, and learners who are new to programming generally don't have a good overall understanding to be able to determine if the output is good or bad.
5. While learning how to provide good prompts to an AI tool is a skill, it is supplementary to developing foundational programming skills.
6. AI tools are designed to answer questions and are not designed to help learners develop research and problem solving skills.
7. Without practice in research, problem solving and critical thinking, interviews could be a struggle since it is very likely that applicants would not be allowed to use AI tools.

We do not recommend using AI tools for your learning.

## Managing your study time

You will have more success by putting **consistent** time into it rather than working on it once a week. Building a habit of studying every day at a specific time and with a specific goal will ensure that you make consistent progress.

It may take you longer than others to grasp concepts, or it may take you less time. This doesn't mean you're smarter or less capable than others; it means you've had differing life experiences. The curriculum is self-paced and allows you to get a solid grasp of concepts before moving on.

Deadlines cause unneeded stress. Creating your own deadlines can lead to rushing through concepts that should not be rushed. This course is very research based, meaning you will have to do research to complete tasks and projects. There's no guarantee you will find the right article or post quickly enough to meet your deadlines, but you will likely learn a lot along the way. People that do this kind of research and strive to write better solutions tend to become better developers in the future.

Long story short: Don't worry, just go learn!

## Pitfalls to avoid

### Procrastination

Procrastination will be your biggest enemy when trying to make progress.

**Solution:** The Pomodoro Technique is a way of managing your time in order to stay focused. The idea is to set a timer for 25 minutes and to work on a task until the timer goes off. Once you've successfully focused on work for 25 minutes, take a 5 minute break. After you've completed four 25 minute blocks of work, take a longer 15–30 minute break. The Pomodoro technique is great for avoiding procrastination as it forces you to work without distractions.

### Not taking breaks

As you get into the material, you may feel compelled to continuously study for long periods of time. It might seem like you are getting more work done at first, but this often leads to burnout. It may seem counterintuitive, but you will actually get more done if you regularly step back to recharge your brain and body.

**Solution:** Use the Pomodoro Technique to time how often and how long to take your well-deserved breaks.

### Digital distractions

Digital distractions are email, notifications, and time-wasting websites. These distractions break your focus and make procrastination tempting.

**Solution:** Turn off notifications and limit your time on distracting sites during study time.

### Physical distractions

Physical distractions are distractions from your environment, like a TV in the background or other people talking.

**Solution:** Find a quiet place where you can focus on your studies. If that's not an option, noise cancelling headphones or a library can help.

### Rabbit holes

Because we cover so much material and link to so many resources, it is easy to get pulled into rabbit holes by spending time trying to learn all there is to know about a subject that you aren't ready for. The curriculum is structured so that the important things you need to know are covered exactly when you need them.

**Solution:** Stick to the path laid out as much as possible. Try to limit time spent going down rabbit holes.

### Comparing yourself to others

Students often compare themselves to others who are farther along. This is a recipe for depression and frustration.

**Solution:** Only compare yourself to your past self. Have your abilities and knowledge improved from where you were last week, last month, or last year? Be proud of the progress that you've made!

### Counterproductive note-taking

Taking a lot of notes throughout your journey can be time-consuming and often leads to wasted effort.

**Solution:** Instead of taking notes to use as direct references, make notes that can serve as prompts for further research. It is important to get comfortable with reading documentation.

## Conclusion

Learning any new skill is a journey full of speed bumps and obstacles to overcome. We hope that the principles laid out here will put you in a much better position to succeed and get the most out of your learning.
