## Introduction

So here it is: it's time to actually start *making things*. This section will teach you the basics of HTML and CSS, the two foundational building blocks of pretty much everything on the web.

## Lesson overview

This section contains a general overview of topics that you will learn in this lesson.

## HTML and CSS

HTML and CSS are two languages that work together to create everything that you see when you look at something on the internet.

**HTML** is the raw data that a webpage is built out of. All the text, links, cards, lists, and buttons are created in HTML. HTML puts *information* on a webpage.

**CSS** is what adds *style* to those plain elements. CSS positions that information, gives it color, changes the font, and makes it look great!

Many resources refer to HTML and CSS as *programming languages*, but if you want to get technical, that is not quite accurate. They are only concerned with *presenting* information. They are not used to program any logic. **JavaScript**, which you will learn later, is a programming language because it's used to make webpages *do* things—respond to clicks, update content, and so on.

Yet there is quite a lot you can do with just HTML and CSS, and you will definitely need them both. The following lessons focus on giving you the tools you need to be successful once you get to the JavaScript content.

## Summary

- **HTML** = structure and content (headings, paragraphs, links, images, lists, etc.).
- **CSS** = presentation (layout, colors, fonts, spacing).
- **JavaScript** = behavior (interactivity, logic, dynamic updates).

You need all three to build modern web experiences, but HTML and CSS are where you start: they define what is on the page and how it looks.
