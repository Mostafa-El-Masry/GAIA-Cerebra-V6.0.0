# Urge Surfing

Urge surfing is a way to ride out an urge without acting on it.

Sit quietly. When an urge arises—to check something, to leave, to react—imagine it as a wave. Notice its shape: the build-up, the peak, the decline. Do not feed it or fight it. Simply watch.

Your only task is to stay with the wave until it passes. Urges are time-limited. When the timer ends, note that you remained present.
