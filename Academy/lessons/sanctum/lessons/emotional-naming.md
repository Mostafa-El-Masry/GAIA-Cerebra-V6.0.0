# Emotional Naming

Naming an emotion can create a small distance between you and the feeling.

Sit quietly. Notice what you feel in this moment. If nothing is strong, that is fine. If something is present—sadness, restlessness, calm—name it in your mind or aloud: "I notice sadness" or "There is restlessness."

Do not try to change the emotion. Simply label it. You can repeat the name a few times. When the timer ends, release the practice and return to the room.
