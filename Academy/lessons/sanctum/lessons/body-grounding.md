# Body Grounding

This practice uses the body to anchor attention in the present.

Sit or stand. Feel the points of contact: feet on the floor, legs on the chair, hands resting. Notice the weight of your body.

Scan slowly from your feet to the top of your head. For each area, name the sensation (pressure, warmth, coolness, tension) without judging. If your mind wanders, return to the next part of the body.

When the timer ends, take one full breath and open your eyes.
