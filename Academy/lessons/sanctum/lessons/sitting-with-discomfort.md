# Sitting With Discomfort

This practice invites you to stay present with discomfort instead of avoiding or reacting to it.

Find a quiet place. Sit in a comfortable position. Close your eyes or soften your gaze.

When you notice discomfort—physical or emotional—acknowledge it without trying to change it. Notice where it sits in your body. Notice any urge to move away or fix it. Stay with the sensation for a few breaths.

There is no goal except to observe. When the timer ends, open your eyes and return to the room.
