# Emotional Disengagement Protocol

## Purpose
To break emotional attachment loops during or after interaction with a triggering person.

This protocol does not analyze emotions.
It does not resolve relationships.
It creates distance.

## Duration
3–7 minutes.

## Steps

1. Identify the trigger
   - Name the person or situation silently.
   - Do not describe details.

2. Externalize
   - Say internally: "This reaction is happening inside me."
   - The reaction is not the person.

3. Boundary Statement
   - Say internally:
     "I do not engage emotionally right now."

4. Attention Shift
   - Focus on a physical anchor (feet, breath, hands) for 60 seconds.

5. Exit
   - Say internally:
     "This session is complete."

No journaling.
No interpretation.
