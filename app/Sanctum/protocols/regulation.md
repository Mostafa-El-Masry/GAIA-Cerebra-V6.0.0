# Regulation Protocol

## Purpose
To stabilize the nervous system during heightened emotional or physical arousal.

This protocol does not analyze thoughts.
It does not process emotions.
It restores baseline.

## Duration
3–5 minutes.

## Steps

1. Posture
   - Sit upright or stand.
   - Feet flat on the ground.

2. Breath Regulation
   - Inhale through the nose for 4 seconds.
   - Exhale through the mouth for 6 seconds.
   - Repeat 6 times.

3. Physical Anchor
   - Press feet gently into the floor.
   - Notice pressure for 60 seconds.

4. Muscle Release
   - Tighten shoulders for 5 seconds.
   - Release fully.
   - Repeat once.

5. Closure
   - Say internally:
     "My body is settling."
     "This session is complete."

No journaling.
No reflection.
