# Sanctum — Phase Zero

Sanctum is a reactive stabilization system.

It is not a lesson path.
It is not scheduled emotional work.
It is used only when dysregulation or triggering occurs.

## When to use Sanctum
- After an emotional trigger
- During rising agitation
- Before anticipated contact with a triggering person

## When NOT to use Sanctum
- For reflection
- For analysis
- For processing memories
- For learning

## Calendar Behavior
A Sanctum day on the Academy calendar does not require action.
It indicates availability only.

If no trigger occurs, no action is taken.

## Modes
- Regulation: body and nervous system stabilization
- Disengagement: mental separation from a triggering person or narrative
